            <h3>Always discover something new in Sydney</h3>
            <p>
              Sydney is a city that loves to eat. From fine dining restaurant

              Meet the makers, forage for greens or settle in for a long lunch
              and you'll soon learn that food is at the heart of the harbour
              city.

                  spot to breathe, but there's nothing else quite like it.
